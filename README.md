# Jame Gam #26
Theme: You're the monster
Special object: Card

## Controls
- Vim-bindings
    - K: up, J: down, L: right, H: left

## Mechanics
- Access cards to access terminals
    - different levels of permissions
- Terminals for writing commands to install and ruin software
- Avoid suspicion and don't let anyone detect your intentional mishaps

## Story
You are a tech worker. Your vacation is coming up after this workday and a developer has just provided you a faulty release that you're supposed to test. 
You decide to run it in production. Said release requires huge database migrations. 

## Ideas
- Terminal system for access cards/"hacking"
    - 80x24 characters
        - When you reach the end, wrap everything around to the first line
    - Every terminal has their own history and screen
    - Purpose is to clear and log out after everything, otherwise you might be found out
- Access/code cards
    - Get from dialogue or loot
    - Have to put them back to avoid suspicion
